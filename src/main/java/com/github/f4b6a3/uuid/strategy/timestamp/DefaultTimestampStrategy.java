/**
 * Strategy that provides the current timestamp.
 * 
 * This is an implementation of {@link TimestampStrategy} that provides
 * millisecond resolution. The timestamp resolution is simulated by adding the
 * next value of a counter that is incremented at every call to the method
 * {@link TimestampStrategy#getTimestamp()}.
 * 
 * The counter's range is from 0 to 9,999, that is, the number of 100-nanosecond
 * intervals per millisecond.
 * 
 * The counter is initialized with a random number between 0 and 255 to void
 * duplicates in the case of multiple time-based generators running in parallel.
 * 
 * ### RFC-4122 - 4.2.1.2. System Clock Resolution
 * 
 * (4a) A high resolution timestamp can be simulated by keeping a count of the
 * number of UUIDs that have been generated with the same value of the system
 * time, and using it to construct the low order bits of the timestamp. The
 * count will range between zero and the number of 100-nanosecond intervals per
 * system time interval.
 *
 * ### RFC-4122 - 4.2.1.2. System Clock Resolution
 * 
 * (3b) If a system overruns the generator by requesting too many UUIDs within a
 * single system time interval, the UUID service MUST either return an error, or
 * stall the UUID generator until the system clock catches up.
